### How it works

1. Create an application in the [dashboard](https://cloudterms.dev/dashboard).
2. Add all your apps legal documents on the terms page.
3. Create an API Key and add it to your apps `.env`.
4. Intergrate CloudTerms into your JavaScript or TypeScript app using one of our [SDKs](./sdks).
